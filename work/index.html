                            <p>
                                I’m a lead product manager at Planning Center,
                                where I create web-based and native mobile
                                software for churches and their congregants.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over the last eight years, I’ve held a variety
                                of roles across design and product. I’ve guided
                                the end-to-end product lifecycle, directly
                                managed interdisciplinary teams of developers
                                and designers, championed design systems,
                                partnered with our marketing team on customer
                                research and positioning, and driven
                                cross-product strategy and cohesion initiatives,
                                while still obsessing over visual polish, empty
                                states, and UX microinteractions.

                                Each product I’ve led has come with its own set
                                of challenges and opportunities — but what I
                                brought to all of them was a UX-first,
                                experience-driven approach and strong advocacy
                                for design.

                            <h3>Planning Center Registrations</h3>
                            <p>
                                Churches of all shapes and sizes use
                                Registrations to create signups for events and
                                opportunities as diverse as they are. Supporting
                                this gamut of uses led to immense complexity.
                                But to foster growth, I knew the product needed
                                to be more accessible to new users. We needed to
                                provide a more curated experience — opinionated
                                but still flexible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To streamline the experience and bring clarity
                                to overlapping feature sets while still
                                preserving power-user workflows, we focused on
                                clear, explicit UI — approachable but not overly
                                magical — and progressively revealed more
                                advanced options depending on whether that
                                functionality was discouraged, allowed, or
                                encouraged in a given context.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These changes were incremental and often subtle,
                                but as we made them, we watched Registrations
                                become the fastest-growing product in our
                                ecosystem while still retaining our biggest
                                customers.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Planning Center Home</h3>
                            <p>
                                If the challenge of Registrations is
                                approachability, the challenge of Home is
                                differentiation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Churches have a unique set of needs and their
                                rhythms are unrelentingly cyclical.
                                <em>Sunday is always coming.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That’s why they have purpose-built software for
                                things like service planning, volunteer
                                scheduling, and event coordination. But for task
                                management and information sharing, they’re left
                                to piece together generic tools and manual
                                processes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In Home, we had the opportunity to create a
                                collaborative workspace to meet these unserved
                                needs. I led zero-to-one for our task management
                                product, building common features — like
                                repeating tasks and shared task lists — in
                                uncommon ways and leveraging the value of our
                                multi-product ecosystem through things like
                                automations and relationships.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Church Center</h3>
                            <p>
                                Whereas Planning Center is for church staff,
                                Church Center is for congregants — our
                                customers’ customers. On Church Center, we offer
                                a cohesive end-user experience by seamlessly
                                integrating features from across our
                                multi-product ecosystem.

                            <p>
                                Advocating for end-users in a B2B product is a
                                unique and compelling challenge, and I’ve had
                                the opportunity to do so from multiple vantage
                                points: initially as the first product designer,
                                leading design for the MVP of the mobile app and
                                creating a cross-platform design system to unify
                                the user experience across web and app; and now,
                                several years later, as the product manager,
                                building alignment across teams as we try to
                                make an increasingly complex product feel simple
                                to the 2.2 million people who use it every
                                month.
