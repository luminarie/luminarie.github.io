<p>I spent the first few weeks of quarantine both feeling like it was really hard and feeling ashamed that it was so hard. I shook my head at my own lack of resiliency.&nbsp;We're not in a war zone;&nbsp;no one in my family is sick; we haven't lost our home or our jobs; the empty shelf-stable food aisles at the grocery store don't count as a famine. If the bottom tier of&nbsp;Maslow's hierarchy of needs is covered, I should be fine.<br><br>And yet, I'm not fine.<br><br>But I've let myself acknowledge that&nbsp;<em>this is not nothing</em>. And of all the strange responses, this is the one that helps me the most.</p>
